Welcome to my creative world!

I am a director currently based in Atlanta, GA. My films aim to explore the core of complex human experiences through vehicles such as dark comedy, introspection, and social commentary. Whether you have a work inquiry or just want to say hello, please feel free to reach out. I strongly believe in the power of community and collaboration. I hope you have a good day _virtual hug ðŸ«‚_
